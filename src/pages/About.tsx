            We built AutoPitch Ai to solve a very specific problem: understanding why a landing page isn't converting, and fixing it fast.
          </p>
          <p className="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            In the early days of building our own SaaS, we spent countless hours manually auditing competitors, writing 
            outreach scripts, and drafting proposals. It was a tedious process that didn't scale.
          </p>
          <p className="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            AutoPitch Ai changes that. By combining advanced heuristic analysis with LLM-powered context generation, 
            we can instantly identify the fundamental friction points in any funnel.
